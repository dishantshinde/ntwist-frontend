# Multi-Page Flash Site

A simple multi-page frontend project demonstrating fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This project includes a contact form, sortable list viewer, and FAQ accordion — all accessible via a sidebar layout.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Page 1 – Contact Form

- Collects user details: Name, Email, and Message.
- Validates inputs using HTML5 form validation.
- Displays a modal confirmation on successful form submission using JavaScript.

### 🔹 Page 2 – Sortable List Viewer

- Shows a hardcoded list of names in an unordered list.
- Includes a **Sort Alphabetically** button.
- Includes a **Reset** button to restore the original order.
- Sorting is handled with pure JavaScript without reloading the page.

### 🔹 Page 3 – FAQ Accordion

- Built using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
- Utilizes the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags to expand/collapse questions.
- Provides clean and accessible interaction.

### 🔹 Shared Sidebar Navigation

- Present on all pages.
- Links to each of the three main sections.
- Highlights the active page using a CSS `.active` class.
